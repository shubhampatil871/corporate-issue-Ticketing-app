## To-do's

##### devlope module without docker first and later you can combine all in a docker compose.

1. Project Initialization
     Initialize Node.js app (npm init).
     Install necessary dependencies: express, pg (PostgreSQL), sequelize (or another ORM), redis, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, etc.
     Set up Docker:
     Write Dockerfile for Node.js app.
     Write docker-compose.yml to manage Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis services.
     Test Docker containers to ensure services are running.


2. Database Setup (PostgreSQL)
     Set up PostgreSQL connection using pg or Sequelize ORM.
     Define and create database schema:
     Users table (id, name, email, password, role, created_at).
     Tickets table (id, user_id, title, description, status, priority, created_at, updated_at).
     Ticket Status table (id, ticket_id, status, updated_at).
     Relations: Establish relations between users and tickets.
     Write migrations and seeders if using an ORM like Sequelize.
3. API Development (Express)
    Authentication & Authorization:

     Set up JWT-based authentication.
     Create routes:
     POST /api/register: Register new users.
     POST /api/login: Login users and generate JWT token.
     Implement middleware for protecting routes (authMiddleware).

    Ticket Management:
    
     Create CRUD routes for tickets:
     GET /api/tickets: List all tickets.
     GET /api/tickets/:id: Get a specific ticket.
     POST /api/tickets: Create a new ticket.
     PUT /api/tickets/:id: Update ticket details.
     DELETE /api/tickets/:id: Delete a ticket.
     Add filtering and pagination for listing tickets.
     Implement validation for inputs (e.g., using express-validator).

    User Management:
    
     GET /api/users: List all users (admin route).
     GET /api/users/:id: Get a specific userâ€™s details.
     PUT /api/users/:id: Update user information.
     DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete a user (admin only).

4. Redis Integration
 Install Redis client (redis npm package).
 Set up Redis caching for frequently accessed endpoints (e.g., ticket listings).
 Implement cache invalidation strategies for when tickets are created/updated.
